//! Doppler provider
//!
//! This provider integrates with [Doppler](https://doppler.com) to store and
//! retrieve secrets over its REST API, in Monosecret 0.21 and later.
//!
//! # Authentication
//!
//! A Doppler token supplied as the `token` provider credential, or via the
//! `DOPPLER_TOKEN` environment variable that Doppler's own CLI uses. Any
//! Doppler token authenticates; two are worth naming:
//!
//! - a **service account** token (`dp.sa.`), scoped to a workplace by grants,
//!   which can reach every project and config it was granted;
//! - a **service token** (`dp.st.`), pinned by Doppler to exactly one project
//!   and config.
//!
//! A personal (`dp.pt.`) or CLI (`dp.ct.`) token also authenticates, but
//! Doppler withholds a `restricted` secret's value from a token tied to a user
//! identity, so such a read is refused rather than answered. See
//! [`secret_value`].
//!
//! Every request names its project and config explicitly, so a pinned token
//! asked for coordinates it does not cover is refused by Doppler rather than
//! quietly answered from wherever it happens to point. See [`Call::request`].
//!
//! # URI Format
//!
//! `doppler://PROJECT[/CONFIG]`
//!
//! The project is required. When no config is given, the Monosecret profile
//! names it, so a `prd` profile reads Doppler's `prd` config. Profile names are
//! free-form, so naming them after the Doppler configs they read needs no
//! mapping at all.
//!
//! Pinning a config instead makes every profile read that one. That is for the
//! manifests whose profiles are named something else already (`production`
//! against a config named `prd`), or spelled in a way Doppler cannot use as a
//! config name at all (`Production`).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - `doppler://myapp` -- the profile names the config
//! - `doppler://myapp/prd` -- every profile reads the `prd` config
//!
//! # Secret Naming
//!
//! A secret is stored under its own key, verbatim, in the config named by the
//! profile:
//!
//! ```text
//! project "myapp", profile "production", key "DATABASE_URL"
//!   -> Doppler project myapp        (from the URI)
//!      Doppler config  production   (the profile)
//!      secret name     DATABASE_URL (verbatim)
//! ```
//!
//! Verbatim names are the point of this provider: an application reads
//! `DATABASE_URL` from its environment, and a convention that stored it as
//! `MONOSECRET_MYAPP_PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` would be useless for that. Doppler
//! has a native environment axis, so mapping the profile onto a config buys real
//! profile isolation *and* verbatim names, which a flat store cannot offer both
//! of at once.
//!
//! Doppler spells secret names in a narrow alphabet (`^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`), so a
//! key it cannot store is refused rather than rewritten to fit: rewriting could
//! land two distinct keys on one name, and the collision would be invisible.
//!
//! # Values Doppler Withholds
//!
//! Doppler can answer a secret that exists with HTTP 200 and a *null* value,
//! reporting a visibility (`restricted`) in place of the value. Monosecret
//! reports that as the refusal it is rather than as an absent secret, because
//! reading it as absent would have `monosecret check` offer to set -- and
//! overwrite -- a secret it was never allowed to read. See [`secret_value`].
//!
//! # Storage Model
//!
//! Monosecret's own project name is **unused**: the URI names the Doppler
//! project, which provides the namespace. Two Monosecret projects pointing at
//! one `doppler://project/config` therefore share a namespace, exactly as they
//! do with Bitwarden Secrets Manager. Give them different Doppler projects or
//! configs to keep them apart.
//!
//! Doppler projects and configs must already exist: a write cannot create them,
//! the way a filesystem-shaped store creates a folder.
