title: Null Provider
description: Use committed defaults, ephemeral generation, or run-time prompts without storage
---

:::caution[Version compatibility]
The `null` provider is added in Monosecret 0.2.
:::

The null provider always reports that a value is missing. Monosecret can then
use the declaration's committed `default`, generate a fresh value, or—in
Monosecret 0.2+—ask the operator during `run` when `prompt = true`. This is
useful for non-sensitive environment configuration and values that should exist
for only one invocation or resolution.

## Quick start

Route committed defaults to `null`:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.default]
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = { description = "Spring application profile", default = "local", providers = [
  "null",
] }

[profiles.staging]
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = { default = "staging" }
```

```bash
$ monosecret run --profile staging -- mvn spring-boot:run
```

This keeps the application mode aligned with the Monosecret profile and its
secrets. The same pattern works for values such as `LOCAL_PORT`.

## Ephemeral generation

:::note[Monosecret 0.2+]
Ephemeral generation through `null://` is available starting in Monosecret
0.2.
:::

Route a generated secret to `null` when each materializing resolution should
receive a fresh value without storing it in a provider:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.default]
SESSION_SECRET = { description = "Per-run session secret", type = "base64", generate = { bytes = 32 }, providers = [
  "null",
] }
```

`monosecret run` generates `SESSION_SECRET` once for the resolved environment
and gives that value to the child process. A later `run`, `get`, `check`, or SDK
value-carrying resolution generates a new value. Value-free reports mark the
secret as generated without minting it.

## Ephemeral operator input (0.2+)

:::note[Monosecret 0.2+]
Run-time prompting through `null://` is available starting in Monosecret 0.2.
:::

Combine `prompt = true` with `null` when the value must always come from the
operator and must never be stored:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.default]
DEPLOY_PASSWORD = { description = "One-time deployment password", required = true, prompt = true, providers = [
  "null",
] }
```

`monosecret run -- ./deploy` reads the value through a hidden controlling
terminal prompt, without consuming the child's stdin. The answer is present in
the child environment for that invocation and is then discarded. It is never
passed to `null.set()` or written to a cache. A noninteractive run fails before
the child starts; other commands and SDK resolution do not prompt.

## How it works

Monosecret normally asks the selected provider before using a default or
generating a missing secret. `null` cannot read or store values: reads always
report a missing value, and every ordinary write is rejected. The missing read
lets Monosecret use the committed default or generator without provider I/O.

The provider has no options, credentials, feature flag, or persistent state.
Use it on declarations with defaults, enabled generation, or `prompt = true`
(0.2+). Here `prompt` chooses operator input while `null` chooses ephemeral
handling; with a writable provider the same prompted answer would be saved.
Required declarations with none of those remain missing, and explicit writes
are rejected.

:::danger[Defaults are public configuration]
Manifest defaults are committed to version control in plaintext. Use `default`
only for non-sensitive values. Generated values are not committed, but still
exist in the resolving process and its configured delivery boundary.
:::

:::caution[Ephemeral means unstable]
Generated and prompted values are shared only within one resolution or child
invocation. Do not use `null` for credentials that another process, machine, or
later invocation must retrieve. Use a writable provider for those values.
