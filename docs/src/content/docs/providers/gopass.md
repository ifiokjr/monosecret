title: Gopass Provider
description: GPG-encrypted, git-synced password store integration
---

The Gopass provider integrates with [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/), a multi-user, multi-store abstraction layer on top of `pass` that keeps secrets GPG-encrypted and syncs them via git.

## Quick start

```bash
# Set a secret
$ monosecret set DATABASE_URL --provider gopass
Enter value for DATABASE_URL: postgresql://localhost/mydb
✓ Secret DATABASE_URL saved to gopass

# Get a secret
$ monosecret get DATABASE_URL --provider gopass
postgresql://localhost/mydb

# Run with secrets
$ monosecret run --provider gopass -- npm start
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Install the `gopass` CLI and initialize a password store:

```bash
# macOS
$ brew install gopass

# Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo apt install gopass

# NixOS
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gopass
```

### Authentication

Monosecret uses the GPG identities configured by `gopass`. Confirm that the
target store is initialized and can be unlocked before using the provider.

## Configuration

### URI format

```
gopass://[folder_prefix]
```

- `folder_prefix`: Optional path prefix supporting `{project}`, `{profile}`, and `{key}` placeholders. Defaults to `monosecret/{project}/{profile}/{key}`.

### URI examples

```text
gopass
gopass://monosecret/shared/{profile}/{key}
```

### Project configuration

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
team = "gopass://"

[profiles.default]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Database URL", providers = ["team"] }
```

## Storage model

:::caution[Version compatibility]

A single-line value without surrounding whitespace is stored as a plain text
entry, exactly as `gopass insert` writes it, so `gopass show`, other gopass
tooling, and earlier Monosecret releases keep reading it. A value with line
breaks, leading or trailing whitespace, NUL bytes, or non-UTF-8 content would
not survive that path, so Monosecret stores it with `gopass cat` in gopass's
binary-entry format instead. Read those entries with `gopass cat`; `gopass
show -o` reports that they have no password line.

:::

Each secret is stored under `monosecret/{project}/{profile}/{key}`. Gopass
encrypts the entry with GPG and can synchronize the password store through git.

## Use existing secrets

A secret's [`ref`](/reference/configuration/#secret-references) field names an
existing entry instead: `item` is the full entry path, including any mount-point
prefix for multi-store setups (`field` is not supported). Reads and writes
target that entry in place.

```toml
[profiles.production]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Production DB", ref = { item = "work-store/infra/postgres" }, providers = [
  "gopass",
] }
```

## Advanced configuration

### Shared secrets

By default, secrets are stored under `monosecret/{project}/{profile}/{key}`, which isolates them per project. To share secrets across projects, use a custom folder prefix via the URI:

```toml
# ~/.config/monosecret/config.toml
[defaults.providers]
shared = "gopass://monosecret/shared/{profile}/{key}"
```

The URI supports `{project}`, `{profile}`, and `{key}` placeholders. By omitting `{project}`, multiple projects can read and write the same store entry:

```toml
# monosecret.toml (in project-A and project-B)
[profiles.default]
ARTIFACTORY_USER = { description = "Artifactory user", providers = ["shared"] }
```

Both projects will resolve `ARTIFACTORY_USER` from `monosecret/shared/default/ARTIFACTORY_USER`.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

Text entries, whether written by Monosecret or created with `gopass insert`,
are read from their password line only: Monosecret returns the first line with
surrounding whitespace removed, so a multiline value stored that way comes back
truncated with no error. Writing the secret again with `monosecret set` stores
a multiline value in the binary-entry format, which preserves every byte.
Reading a binary entry costs two decryptions, because Monosecret asks for the
password line first and falls back to the entry body.
