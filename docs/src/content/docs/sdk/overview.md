description: How the SecretSpec language SDKs work
---

SecretSpec ships SDKs for Rust, Python, Go, Ruby, Node.js/TypeScript, and
Haskell. They all resolve secrets from the same declarative `secretspec.toml`,
and they all behave identically, because they share one resolver.

## One resolver, thin clients

Resolution (providers, fallback chains, profiles, generation, `as_path`
materialization) lives in a single Rust core. Each SDK is a thin client over
that core rather than a reimplementation:

- **Rust** uses the library directly, with a compile-time derive macro for
  strongly-typed access.
- **Ruby** (a native C extension) statically links the `secretspec-ffi` C ABI
  at build time; **Go** (purego) loads it at runtime with no cgo. Both exchange
  a small JSON request/response with the core.
- **Haskell** links the same C ABI at build time via the GHC FFI.
- **Python** uses a [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/) native extension, and
  **Node.js/TypeScript** uses a [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/) native addon; both
  embed the same resolver directly and exchange the same JSON request/response
  shape as the C ABI.

Because resolution happens in one place, every provider, chain, profile, and
generator works the same in every language, and a new provider added to the core
is immediately available everywhere with no per-SDK change. A cross-language
conformance suite asserts that all the SDKs reduce the same inputs to the same
result.

## The runtime API

Each SDK mirrors the Rust derive crate's vocabulary: a builder that takes a
provider, profile, and an access reason, and a `load`/`resolve` that returns the
resolved secrets plus the provider and profile used. A missing required secret
is a typed error, distinct from a transport failure (which carries a stable
`kind`). Secrets exposed `as_path` come back as a readable file path.

```python
from secretspec import SecretSpec

resolved = SecretSpec.builder().with_provider("keyring://").with_reason("boot").load()
print(resolved.secrets["DATABASE_URL"].get)
```

See each language's page for the idiomatic spelling: [Rust](/sdk/rust),
[Python](/sdk/python), [Go](/sdk/go), [Ruby](/sdk/ruby),
[Node.js](/sdk/nodejs), and [Haskell](/sdk/haskell).

## Typed access

Beyond the Rust derive macro, typed accessors for the other languages are
generated from the manifest. `secretspec schema` emits a JSON Schema for the
secret shape; [quicktype](https://quicktype.io) turns it into an idiomatic type
and deserializer for any language, which you build from the SDK's `fields()`
map:

```bash
secretspec schema | quicktype -s schema --top-level SecretSpec --lang <language>
```

This keeps the per-language surface tiny: the SDK only provides `fields()`, and
quicktype owns the type generation.

## Distribution

The resolver ships inside each package, so there is nothing extra to install and
no runtime library path to set:

- **Python** builds the resolver into a pyo3 extension shipped as a `cp39-abi3`
  wheel, and **Ruby** statically links the `secretspec-ffi` archive into a
  native C extension in the gem.
- **Haskell** statically links the same archive at build time via the GHC FFI.
- **Go** embeds the `cdylib` in the module and loads it at runtime via purego
  (no cgo); an opt-in `-tags static` build links it statically instead.
- **Node.js** builds the resolver into a napi-rs addon.

Because the resolver is linked or embedded directly, none of the SDKs depend on a
separately installed `cdylib` or an `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`SECRETSPEC_FFI_LIB`
override at runtime.
