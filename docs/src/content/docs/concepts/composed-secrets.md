title: Composed Secrets
description: Derive read-only values from other declared secrets with strict templates

Available since Monosecret 0.2.

Composed secrets derive one exported value from other secrets in the active
profile. They are useful for connection strings, command arguments, and other
formats whose components should remain independently stored:

```toml
[profiles.default]
DB_USER = { description = "Database user" }
DB_PASSWORD = { description = "Database password" }
DB_HOST = { description = "Database host" }

DATABASE_URL = {
  description = "PostgreSQL connection string",
  composed = "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/app"
}
```

`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_HOST` resolve through their ordinary
providers. `DATABASE_URL` is then rendered in memory and exported alongside
them. The composed result is never read from or written to a provider.

## Static dependency graph

Every `${UPPERCASE_NAME}` must name a secret declared in the effective profile.
Reference names must match `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`.
Monosecret validates the complete graph while loading `monosecret.toml`, before
accessing a provider:

- declaration order does not matter;
- a composition may reference another composition;
- unknown references are errors;
- dependency cycles are errors.

```toml
[profiles.default]
USER = { description = "Database user" }
PASSWORD = { description = "Database password" }
HOST = { description = "Database host" }

AUTHORITY = { description = "Database authority", composed = "${USER}:${PASSWORD}" }
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Database URL", composed = "postgres://${AUTHORITY}@${HOST}/app" }
```

This differs deliberately from dotenv expansion, where behavior can depend on
file order, process environment, and how a particular parser handles undefined
or recursive variables.

## Template syntax

Composition is a small, strict language:

| Syntax              | Meaning                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `${UPPERCASE_NAME}` | Insert one declared secret's exported value |
| `$$`                | Insert a literal `$`                        |

For example, `$${EXTERNAL_NAME}` renders the literal text
`${EXTERNAL_NAME}` without treating it as a Monosecret reference.

The following are intentionally unsupported:

- lowercase or mixed-case references such as `${password}` or `${Password}`;
- shell-style expressions such as `${NAME:-fallback}`;
- ambient environment-variable lookup;
- command substitution;
- recursive expansion.

Plain `{` and `}` are literal, so JSON objects, CSS blocks, and regular-expression
quantifiers do not require brace escaping. Substitution is one pass. If
`PASSWORD` contains the literal text `${HOST}`, inserting `${PASSWORD}`
produces `${HOST}`; it is not scanned again. This keeps secret bytes opaque and
prevents values from unexpectedly becoming executable template syntax.

## Missing, empty, and optional values

Missing and empty are different:

- an empty dependency inserts an empty string;
- a missing dependency makes a required composition missing;
- when the composed secret sets `required = false`, a missing dependency omits
  the composed result instead.

Monosecret never silently replaces a missing reference with empty text.
Interactive `monosecret check` prompts for the unresolved provider-backed
dependencies, not for the derived result.

## Read-only behavior

A composed secret cannot also declare `default`, `providers`, `ref`, `type`, or
enabled `generate`. These fields would give the same name two competing value
sources.

- `get` resolves the target's transitive dependencies and prints the result;
- `set` rejects the composed name as read-only;
- `import` skips composed names because there is no stored value to copy;
- `check`, `run`, `export`, and SDK resolution include the composed value like
  any other resolved secret.

## Profiles and inheritance

References are checked against the effective profile after `default` profile
inheritance. A profile may override the template while inheriting component
declarations:

```toml
[profiles.default]
DB_USER = { description = "Database user" }
DB_PASSWORD = { description = "Database password" }
DB_HOST = { description = "Database host" }
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Database URL", composed = "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/app" }

[profiles.development]
DATABASE_URL = { composed = "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/app_dev" }
```

Profile-level storage defaults do not apply to composed secrets, because their
source is the dependency graph rather than a provider. Profile-level
`required` defaults still apply.

## Paths and encoding

When a dependency uses `as_path = true`, its exported temporary-file path is
inserted. Setting `as_path = true` on the composed secret instead writes the
final rendered value to a temporary file.

Composition performs raw string concatenation. It does not URL-encode or
JSON-encode values: Monosecret cannot infer whether a component is a username,
password, host, path, query parameter, or structured value. Store each
component in the representation required by the destination format. To export
the resolved secret map as safely encoded JSON, use
`monosecret export --format json`.

See the [`composed` configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#composed-secrets)
for the field-level constraints.
