description: See how Monosecret and its providers work together
---

Monosecret is the application-facing layer of a secrets system. It defines what
an application needs, resolves those requirements across environments, and
delivers the resulting values through its CLI and
[provider-independent SDKs](/sdk/overview/). Providers connect that layer to
concrete value sources. Depending on the backend, they can add secure storage,
identity, access control, availability, and provider-native operations.

This separation keeps [`monosecret.toml`](/concepts/declarative/) portable. A
developer can use the system keyring, CI can supply environment variables, and
production can use Vault or a cloud secret manager without changing the
application's secret contract.

The distinction is intentional: Monosecret provides portable application
semantics, while each provider determines how its provider-backed values are
stored, protected, and operated. Some providers, such as dotenv and environment
variables, intentionally provide fewer safeguards. Monosecret's
[default audit log](/concepts/audit/) complements provider logs by recording the
project, profile, secret name, outcome, actor, and reason seen by the application
workflow. It is a size-bounded, best-effort local log, not a replacement for
central compliance records.

## Supported providers

See [Available providers](/concepts/providers/#available-providers) for the
provider comparison, including storage backend, read and write support,
encryption at rest, and TPM-backed keys.

Providers can be mixed within one project. For example, an application can
read a shared credential from 1Password in the production profile, read the same
secret from the system keyring in the development profile, and accept a
deployment token from the environment in CI. A secret can also define an ordered
fallback chain, which tries the next provider when an earlier provider does not
return the value. Monosecret keeps those storage decisions outside the
application's code.
