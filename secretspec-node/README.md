# secretspec (Node.js SDK)

Node.js / TypeScript bindings for [SecretSpec](https://secretspec.dev/), a
declarative secrets manager. A thin wrapper over a napi-rs native addon
(`secretspec.node`) that statically embeds the Rust resolver, so the SDK inherits
every provider with no JS-side logic and nothing to load at runtime. Resolution
happens in the Rust core.

```js
const { SecretSpec } = require("secretspec");

const resolved = SecretSpec.builder()
  .withProvider("keyring://")
  .withProfile("production")
  .withReason("boot web app")
  .load();

console.log(resolved.provider, resolved.profile);
const db = resolved.secrets.DATABASE_URL;
console.log(db.get()); // the value, or the file path for as_path secrets
resolved.setAsEnv(); // export everything into process.env
```

A missing required secret throws `MissingRequiredError`; any other failure
throws `SecretSpecError` (with a stable `.kind`). TypeScript declarations ship
in `index.d.ts`.

## Cleanup

`as_path` secrets are materialized to temp files that outlive the call. Call
`resolved.dispose()` (or `using resolved = builder.load()`) when done so the
secret files do not accumulate in the temp dir.

## Value-free report

`report()` (and `reportAsync()`) returns the inventory/preflight view: per-secret
status and provenance, never a value. Unlike `load()`, it does not throw when a
required secret is missing — it appears as a `SecretReport` with status
`"missing_required"`.

```js
const report = SecretSpec.builder().withProfile("production").report();
for (const s of report.secrets) console.log(s.name, s.status, s.required);
```

## Native addon

The resolver is compiled into the napi-rs addon (`secretspec.node`), so there is
no separate library to locate and no `SECRETSPEC_FFI_LIB` to set. Prebuilt
per-platform addons are published as npm packages (no install-time native build);
from a source checkout the addon is built by `scripts/build-addon.sh`.
