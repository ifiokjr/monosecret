# secretspec (Go SDK)

Go bindings for [SecretSpec](https://secretspec.dev/), a declarative secrets
manager. A thin client over the `secretspec-ffi` C ABI. Resolution happens in the
Rust core, so the SDK inherits every provider with no Go-side logic. By default
the resolver is loaded at runtime via
[purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego) (dlopen, no cgo), keeping `go get`
toolchain-free; `-tags static` instead links it in statically (see below).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	secretspec "github.com/cachix/secretspec/secretspec-go"
)

func main() {
	resolved, err := secretspec.New().
		WithProvider("keyring://").
		WithProfile("production").
		WithReason("boot web app").
		Load()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(resolved.Provider, resolved.Profile)
	db := resolved.Secrets["DATABASE_URL"]
	fmt.Println(db.Get()) // the value, or the file path for as_path secrets
	resolved.SetAsEnv()   // export everything into the process environment
}
```

A missing required secret returns `*MissingRequiredError`; any other failure
returns `*Error` (with a stable `.Kind`).

## Cleanup

`as_path` secrets are materialized to temp files that outlive the call. Call
`resolved.Close()` (e.g. `defer resolved.Close()`) when done so the secret files
do not accumulate in the temp dir.

## Value-free report

`Report()` returns the inventory/preflight view: per-secret status and
provenance, never a value. Unlike `Load()`, it does not fail when a required
secret is missing — it appears as a `SecretReport` with `Status`
`"missing_required"`.

```go
report, _ := secretspec.New().WithProfile("production").Report()
for _, s := range report.Secrets {
	fmt.Println(s.Name, s.Status, s.Required)
}
```

## Binding the native resolver

### Default: purego (dlopen, no cgo)

The `secretspec-ffi` cdylib is resolved at runtime, in order:

1. The `SECRETSPEC_FFI_LIB` environment variable (an explicit path).
2. A library embedded at build time with `-tags embed_lib`.
3. A Cargo `target` directory found by searching up from the working directory
   (the development path).

This keeps `go get` toolchain-free; the cdylib is loaded at runtime rather than
linked. Provide it via `SECRETSPEC_FFI_LIB` / a Cargo checkout, or stage the
per-platform library into `lib/` and build `-tags embed_lib` (embedded via
`go:embed`, extracted to a per-user, owner-only cache directory at first use).
Neither the cdylib nor the archive is shipped through the Go module proxy (which
does not carry binary assets); they are attached to GitHub releases.

### `-tags static`: cgo, statically linked

For a self-contained binary with no runtime library to locate, link the resolver
statically. This uses **cgo** (a C toolchain is required) and links
`libsecretspec_ffi.a` directly into the Go binary:

```bash
# Stage the archive + header + generated cgo LDFLAGS, then build with cgo.
bash scripts/stage-staticlib.sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags static ./...
```

On Linux this can be made **fully static** (no dynamic libraries at all) by
building the archive for a musl target and passing the static link flags:

```bash
SECRETSPEC_FFI_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl \
  SECRETSPEC_FFI_PROFILE=release bash scripts/stage-staticlib.sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags static \
  -ldflags '-linkmode external -extldflags "-static"' ./...
```

macOS links the archive in but stays self-contained-except-system-frameworks (no
static libSystem). Windows stays on the default purego path. The prebuilt
archives are attached to GitHub releases (`go-static.yml`).
