//! The SecretSpec C ABI: a deliberately narrow, JSON-in/JSON-out boundary.
//!
//! The entire native surface is three functions. Richness lives in the
//! versioned JSON contract, not in a wide C API, so that every consumer of
//! this ABI (Go via purego, Ruby via ffi, Haskell via the GHC FFI) stays a
//! thin shell: marshal a request string in, get a response string out, free it.
//! Python (pyo3) and Node (napi-rs) skip this C ABI and call
//! `secretspec::resolve_json` directly, but share the same JSON envelope
//! contract. Resolution logic lives only in the `secretspec` crate; this is a
//! wrapper.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! - [`secretspec_resolve`] takes a UTF-8, NUL-terminated JSON **request** and
//!   returns a heap-allocated, NUL-terminated JSON **response envelope**. The
//!   caller owns the returned pointer and must free it with [`secretspec_free`].
//! - [`secretspec_abi_version`] returns a static version string (do not free).
//!
//! ## Request JSON
//!
//! ```json
//! { "path": "…/secretspec.toml", "provider": "keyring://",
//!   "profile": "production", "reason": "boot", "no_values": false }
//! ```
//!
//! All fields are optional. `path` omitted means "walk up from the working
//! directory" like the CLI. `no_values` strips secret values from the response.
//!
//! ## Response envelope
//!
//! ```json
//! { "ok": true,  "response": { …ResolveResponse… } }
//! { "ok": false, "error": { "kind": "io", "message": "…" } }
//! ```
//!
//! `ok: true` carries the value-carrying [`secretspec::ResolveResponse`] (which
//! still reports domain failures like `missing_required` in its own fields).
//! `ok: false` means the call itself failed (bad manifest, provider error,
//! reason policy). This separates transport failure from "a required secret is
//! missing", which the SDK surfaces differently.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Returned response strings carry secret values (unless `no_values`). Treat
//! them as sensitive and free them promptly. The host language's heap cannot be
//! zeroized; for file-shaped secrets prefer `as_path`, whose value never crosses
//! the boundary (only the temp-file path does).
