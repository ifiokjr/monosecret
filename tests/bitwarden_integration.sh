# Monosecret Bitwarden Integration Test Script
# Tests the Bitwarden provider against actual vault data
# Usage: ./bitwarden_integration.sh [BW_SESSION]
#
# Set MONOSECRET_BIN to a pre-built monosecret binary (e.g. an instrumented
# coverage build) to skip the local build and run that binary instead.
#
# The script auto-creates test items if they don't exist,
# and removes them on clean exit (unless --keep-test-data is passed).
#
# FUTURE WORK: full automation via vaultwarden
# ---------------------------------------------
# This script currently requires a real, unlocked vault (BW_SESSION), so a
# human with a Bitwarden account is always in the loop. The ultimate way to
# automate it is to run against a local vaultwarden server (a
# Bitwarden-compatible reimplementation) instead of the real cloud:
#
#   docker run --rm -p 8087:80 -e SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true vaultwarden/server
#   bw config server http://localhost:8087
#   # bootstrap a throwaway fixture account, login, unlock, export BW_SESSION
#
# With a local, disposable server the account credentials become committable
# test fixtures rather than secrets: any dev can run the test with zero
# setup, and CI (including fork PRs) needs no repository secrets. Fidelity
# stays high because the genuine `bw` CLI is still the client under test.
# vaultwarden is also packaged in nixpkgs (pkgs.vaultwarden), so the devenv
# shell could provide it as a plain binary, no Docker required.
#
# Caveats: `bw` has no `register` command, so account bootstrap needs either
# a call to the registration API or a pre-seeded SQLite db fixture; and since
# vaultwarden is not the official server, an occasional manual run against
# real Bitwarden cloud would still be worth keeping.
#
# FUTURE WORK: absorbing the sibling bw scripts
# ---------------------------------------------
# There are now three bw test scripts, and vaultwarden_harness.sh invokes each
# of them separately:
#
#   bitwarden_integration.sh            this file — the broad behavioral suite
#   bitwarden_regression_findings.sh    the PR #166 review findings (R1-R4)
#   bitwarden_collection_addressing.sh  organization/collection addressing (C3)
#
# Folding the latter two in here would give one entry point and one summary.
# They should be *invoked*, never copied: each owns fixtures the others do not,
# and duplicating assertions is how the two of them would drift apart. What it
# would take:
#
#   - Reconcile the shell contracts. This script uses `set -e`; both siblings
#     use `set -uo pipefail` and deliberately exit non-zero to report failures.
#     Called directly, that designed exit would kill this script mid-suite, so
#     the call has to run with `set +e` and capture the status.
#   - Fold the counters rather than merge them. This script counts
#     TESTS_RUN/TESTS_PASSED/TESTS_FAILED through run_test; the regression
#     script counts FIXED/REPRODUCED through its own `report`. The practical
#     conversion is one parent-level pass/fail per child, with the child's own
#     output echoed through for detail.
#   - Contain the working directory. Each sibling mktemps a directory, cd's
#     into it, and writes its own monosecret.toml; this script writes
#     monosecret.toml into the current directory. Running a child in a subshell
#     keeps its `cd` from leaking into the tests that follow.
#   - Keep the EXIT traps apart. All three install `trap cleanup EXIT`. In a
#     subshell the child's trap fires on its own exit, which is correct, but
#     this script's cleanup_test_data must not delete items the child is still
#     using — so children run to completion between parent test groups, never
#     alongside them.
#   - Respect the preconditions. Both siblings need target/debug/monosecret,
#     which this script builds, so they can only run after that step.
#     bitwarden_collection_addressing.sh additionally needs the organization
#     fixture (BW_TEST_ORG_ID and friends) and skips itself without it.
