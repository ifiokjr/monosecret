# End-to-end tests for organization and collection addressing (review finding C3).
#
# `bw list items --collectionid` accepts a UUID, but `bw://myorg@dev-secrets`
# reads as a pair of names, so the provider resolves names to ids. These tests
# prove that resolution reaches one specific collection rather than the whole
# organization.
#
# The fixture that makes them meaningful is two collections holding an item of
# the *same name* with different values. Without name resolution both addresses
# find nothing; if the two `bw list` filters were combined (the CLI ORs them)
# both addresses would find the same superset and the dev/prod assertions could
# not both hold. Only a correct implementation passes.
#
# Requires the organization fixture from tests/vaultwarden_harness.sh. Skips
# cleanly when it is absent, so this stays runnable against a personal vault.
set -uo pipefail

# See bitwarden_integration.sh: without a reason, `[project].require_reason`
# ("agents" by default) denies every get/set under a coding agent.
